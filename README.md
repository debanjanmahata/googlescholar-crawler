# googlescholar-crawler
This is a crawler for crawling papers from google scholar (http://scholar.google.com). Credits for this code goes to (https://github.com/ckreibich/scholar.py) more than me. I have added some features for crawling and collecting research papers from google scholar. I would like to use the collected papers for my own research interest on Scientometrics. Please feel free to use this code and give the right credits.
